						<h2>Passion for the Panini</h2>
						<p>From the days of my childhood I was shown the love and joy of hospitality.  Mom and I would clean house, cook comforting, tasteful dishes.  We would change up decorations and bring in fresh cut flowers from our yard.  Mom had a passion for gardening and we would make mint syrup for ice cream and preserves.  Looking around our country home by the sea, I would see and feel love and comfort in our environment.  It was a place to recover and rejuvenate.</p>
						<p>Every year since I was four years old we volunteered at our local fire station putting on a Thanksgiving dinner. I filled those salt and peper shakers.  We had enjoyable hour with members of our community peeling vegetables.  We scoured the woods for bittersweet and carved out apples for centerpieces we loved creating.  Love and goodness were there.</p>
						<p>I worked in a local ice cream parlor.  My artist side shined through as I offered to repaint the giant ice cream cones on the roof.  My <em>spectacular</em> work was complimented by many.</p>
						<p>The fall of 2009 I had earned the opportunity to attend Rochester Institute of Technology and when I returned home the next summer wanting to make better money now that I had to support my way at college.  My brother recommended me for an <strong>Assistant Server</strong> position at the "Oceanhouse Restaurant" a five star establishment in Westerly, RI.  I served celebraties and poured fine bottles of wine.  It launched my interest to seek more knowledge about wine.</p>
						<p>In my sophomore year I took and elective class called <strong>"Wines & Distilleries"</strong>.  We traveled through New York's wineries, orchards and distilleries.  I learned so much.  My passions grew stronger.  I worked as a server in both four and five star, loving every minute, becoming quite a saleswomen.</p>
						<p>So you must be wondering where the <strong>Panini</strong> sandwiches come in. Well during a cooking experiment involving peperoni, provolone, bread and special spices a delicious grilled sandwich developed.  My mom said I should have a <strong>Panini</strong> sandwich stand down the beach, that I really had a good idea.</p>
						<p>Well RIT wanted me in there <em>Art Program</em>.  Though I love Art I have a strong math side from my dad, the Physics teacher, I choose <em>Electrical Engineering</em>.  I have taken all of what I've learned to <em>Psychology</em> and the study of the "Music Therapy", the affect of <em>music</em> on the brain.</p>
						<p>I could go on and on but the point is I have brought it all together; flavorful, affordable food, atmosphere and community.  Come enjoy and share.</p>
